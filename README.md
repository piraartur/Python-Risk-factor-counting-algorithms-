# Python-Risk-factor-counting-algorithms-

Welcome to my app designed to calculate risk factors, crucial to quantitative investment. I wrote code all alone, except in file vlt.py for jump() function, 
which I credit to stackoverflow user georgexsh (code located here:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46267392/how-to-jump-back-to-a-specific-line-of-code-python).
I wrote this in order to practise python loops, if statements and external libraries. 
This version is beta 1.0 as I call it, I have plans to make it run smoother and calculate more risk factors: cVaR, normal distribution etc.
I want to make new version directly commited to translating for french, italian and polish.
In the near future there will be more technical updates (of course bug fixes, if encountered will be fixed).
###
WHAT THIS BRANCH/REPOSITORY CONTAINS:
a) rsc.py - Working beta
b) vlt.py - Working external module with my own functions that are called by a) and c)
c) testf.py - I used this file as my own notepad where I was testing new functionalities etc. I will not remove this single file, you know, to have more commits
              shown on my profile (You know, I am before proffesional work and my first portfolio and github profile need to look more 'proffesional'
              with more commits. Don't judge me, everyone was here)
d) readme.md - You are here. 
###
HOW TO RUN THIS APP
1) MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE installed before by pip: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, pysimplegui, plotly, yfinance
2) download rsc.py or testf.py and vlt.py
3) If you allready have both files downloaded, locate them in same folder
4) open shell and run either rsc.py or testf.py
5) enjoy!
HOW TO UPLOAD DATA TO ANALYSE INSIDE APP
1) You have to download some csv file with historical quotes, you can find them on stock exchange websites or financial websites
2) Downloaded file with historical quotes throw into folder with app files.

###
CAUTION
This app does have very simple UI, operating only in shell. Next big update will make it use pySimpleGUI library to full extent, so it will not look
as harsh as it looks now. It gets the job done however.
